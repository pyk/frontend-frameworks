# Scratch
My yet-another attempts to build a products from start to
finish.

I will following the current best practice here. I will
wrote the products using a typescript.

First of all init the project:

    npm init

Install the dependencies:

    npm install --save-dev typescript jest ts-jest @types/jest

* `typescript` is a package for typescript compiler
* `@types/node` is a typescript definition for working in node.js environment
* `jest ts-jest @types/jest` are packages for unit testing

okay, all setup.

## Server Side Rendering
All requests should handled by the server.
